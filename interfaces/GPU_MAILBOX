# There are two ways to use a mailbox associated with a channel.
# The first is to use send_message, which returns when the response is received, blocking the caller
# This is good for a simple "conversation" with the GPU
# The second is to register a client, and send messages using queue_message from multiple threads.
# This is more complex, but allows for multiple simultaneous requests on the same channel (it's up to the
# caller to sort them out).

  # Throws an exception if the response doesn't match the request.

  # Sends a message, the response will be passed to the registered client
  # May block while waiting to send the message, but doesn't wait for a response.
